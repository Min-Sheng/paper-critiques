# A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification

## Abstract
The strong performance of deep network heavily relies on abundant labeled examples which requires human annotation cost and are often limited by their scarcity. Few-shot learning aims to recognize novel classes by training with limited labeled examples like human visual system. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of existing few-shot classification algorithms and shows that using deeper backbones significantly reduce the performance differences among them with limited domain differences. Moreover, the authers introduce a modified baseline model and show it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art. A new realistic cross-domain evaluation setting is also investigated to demonstrate that current algorithms fail to address domain shifts.
