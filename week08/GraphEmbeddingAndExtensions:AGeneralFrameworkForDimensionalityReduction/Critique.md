# Graph Embedding and Extensions: A General Framework for Dimensionality Reduction

## Abstract
This paper presents a general framework, referred to as graph embedding, with its linearization, kernelization, and tensorization, which not only provides as an comprehensive concept for understanding and explaining the existing dimensionality reduction algorithms, but also serves as a general platform to develop a new algorithms for dimensionality reduction.

## Contribution
The authers propose a general graph embedding framework for dimensionality reduction and utilize this platform to design a novel algorithm called Marginal Fisher Analysis (MFA) to effectively overcome the limitations oftraditional Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm (LDA) due to data distribution assumptions and available projection directions.

And they also show that the proposed MFA has superiority in face recognition task.
