# ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale Chest X-ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly-Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases

## Abstract
The authers construct a new chest X-ray database Ôºç "ChestX-ray8", which comprises 108,948 frontal-view X-ray from 32,717 patients along with the text-mined 8 disease image labels. They claim that the new dataset is hospital-scale since that it is one order of mignitude larger than previous largest OpenI dataset for chest X-ray. Moreover, they build a benchmark for weakly-supervised classification and localization on this dataset.
